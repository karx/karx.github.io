## Vim
Basically getting started with Vim

## Background
This is going to be an account/attempt for writing a guide for getting comfortable with this amazing tool we know as Vim

## Using Vim!
As of this moment, this is written and edited only using vim.
Firstly to anyone reading this, I would strongly recoomend you trying out
```
vimtutor
```

If this doesn't work, either the prompt will tell you that it is not installed, or it would open up a blank vi session. 
This would mean that you are using an ubuntu system and have vim-tiny which is the default installation of Ubuntu Desktop.

You can fix this by simply installing vim by running the following command in the terminal.

```
sudo apt install vim

```
