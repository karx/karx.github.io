# Software-as-example
aka simulations

## Abstract
`Simulations` is the essence of Computer Science.

Modeling and validating a system

It is possible to ovserve exponentially larger sets of outcomes, and observe evolutions across multiple lifetimes.

This entry is more like discussion and listing of a few senarios, where we observe `Software as example`.

## Example 1 - Corrupted Blood incident
On 13th September 2015, a new raid was introduced in `World of Warcraft`, in the 1.7.0 path. 

The end boss, Hakkar the Soulflayer had a highly contagious debuff spell called "Corrupted Blood".

## Example 2 - Management 
A hackers understanding of how to scale systems gives them an unfair advantage when dealing with management.

| sync microservices        | early growth 1-10 teams               |
| async microservices       | sustained hockystick 10-100 teams     |
| distributed               | very new - eg. Open Source Teams      |

## Example 3 - Python's Steering Council governance model

![PEP-8001](/images/software-as-example/PEP_8001.png)

Communities function best when the people most affected by a decision have the primary say in making that decision.

![Different Models](/images/software-as-example/PEP_Models.png)

* Distributed vs hierarchical power
* number of people in leadership roles
* importance of being a core dev
* formalization of process/power vs leaving things implicit
* who decides on PEPs?
* what happens if leadership is bad?
* how much burden is being placed on core devs?
