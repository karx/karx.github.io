# The Simulation 
The Simulation

## Purpose
This doc is to serve as the Simulation Overall view document. This will help me categorize all the threads/work/projects/efforts into the larger scheme of things

## The stucture of the Simulatin
In order for us to categorize, we must have a abstract structure of the simulation. We shall do this iteratively, and while constructing this model, we shall in each session categorize the work.

## Current Iteration - 25th Febuary 2019
The Simulation as of now is stable.

Motivation - This is what we call driving force.
	Current society has been using Money (Fabricated Currency) because of Legacy issues. :P
	Personal motivations are way diffrenet

Social Interactions - This is inteactions of two compute systems.
	There are many known way to this. Talking is one of the best way to interact as the density of information flow is increblily high.
	If we also add visual data to this, the interaction becomes much richer, but sometimes makes it harder for participats to focus on everything, thus causing leakage in the flow of information.

Computing - The way the information is proccesses. The abbstraction of Computes is beyound the scope of this text.
	This is the most fundamental. The first class citizen of this simulation. 
	The archecture is to maximize the potential of these computes.
