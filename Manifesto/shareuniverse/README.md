# ShareUniverse

## Introduction
ShareUniverse is to serve as an Engagement driven Cognitive Revolution Facilitator via Engineering/Programming Interactions (Non-digital) and leveraging technology + the digital mediums as mere facilitators in the process.

Through ShareUniverse, facilitators can really boost the cognitive development of the community++. All members of the community would be able to contribute to the bigger picture by participating and also observe those effects.

ShareUniverse aims to build a system, that can provide engagement driven behaviour building capabilities by meaningful interactions. To do so also requires key feedbacks/logs from such interactions, the more the merrier.


## ShareUniverse Proposition
ShareUniverse will provide a guideline + a toolkit on conduction a Verse building program, where a group/community is selected and then conducts/participates in the program.

The ShareUniverse toolkit will contain everything from Props, items, Apps and content needed for the program, to help conduct, facilitate and maintain the Verse.

The offline interactions (and the direct engagements caused by these meetings) will be central to the system.
Apart from these, some of the key touch points of the systems are the
* The Que
* a Trigger
* interactions
* .

To facilitate these, the following digital tools would help us empower the system.
* Web+Mobile+IoT Devices = Omnipresent presence, for the trigger as well as for reporting
    - For surfacing the instructions/rules of the program
    - for viewing reports 
    - collecting data
* Profile Management System 
    * for individuals
    * for groups
* ShareVerse Engine
    - This engine crunches the real-time numbers (from various sources)
    - Runs computes like grouping people, choosing the next task, etc.


## Current top choices 
* Capture ambient/all voice in the surrounding

```
Pros
Using audio analysis we can have data points for the entire engagement.

Cons
This would very heavily rely on our omnipresence. Alteast one, if now all participant, would have to be capturing and transmitting this data.
```

* Enforcing Video Logs

```
Pros
We would be able to get extremely rich live data + data feed about interactions that are out of scope at the moment. i.e 

Cons
Very high intervention into the routine
```
