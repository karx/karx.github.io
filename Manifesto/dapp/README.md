# Dapp

##
Decentralized Applications (or DApps) are applications that do not rely on a centralized backend running in AWS or Azure that power traditional web and mobile applications (outside of hosting the frontend code itself). Instead, the application interacts directly with a blockchain which can be thought of distributed cluster of nodes analogous to applications interacting directly with a “masterless” cluster of Cassandra nodes with full replication on every peer in an untrusted peer-to-peer network.
