## What is on the other side

## How do we do

```
Given your latitude and longitude, to find the coordinates of the opposite point:
For the latitude, simply change N to S or vice versa; and,
For the longitude, subtract from 180° and change E to W or vice versa (keep in mind when doing this calculation that a minute is 1/60th of a degree, and a second is 1/60th of a minute, and calculate accordingly.)

E.g., the point opposite 40° 21' N 86° 33' W is 40° 21' S 93° 27' E.

If you're using a system which uses signed longitude and latitude (north and east are positive, by convention; south and west are negative), then: take the negative of the latitude; and add 180° to a negative longitude, or subtract 180° from a positive longitude (again remembering minutes and seconds).

## More to do
*  Lotico
A social network of active Lotico Semantic Web community members, provided as RDF via resolvable URIs and a SPARQL endpoint.

`this existed. why no more info about after '20`

* Host own rdf store of this information about people. Or atleast simulated wikidata information

## Test      `   
* For -28.652,  -102.769
we set 28.652,    77.231
