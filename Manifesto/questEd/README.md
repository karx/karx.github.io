## Quest Book
A web/mobile based helper for **Learning**.

* Easy to follow
* Dynamically rendered Maps
* Directions and Objectives
* Logs

It is created to be extremely flexible, and help quantify each Learning Shell. A well-defined START and END.

## Philosophy
All learning, diverse subjects - all paths involve ~500 unique quests which are interconnected. Also, this learning is like **a marathon**.

* There is always a rough sequence
* Sufficient amount - Simultaneously (Some choice)
* Few multiple efficient loops

Planning on a 9-5 or walking hour, having thought through plan & therefore be able to **schedule**, can reduce effort (be ~half)
You are not just learning, but also earning.

## Volatility at Low Levels
When starting, young *age*, very prone to jump the gun and royally screw yourself where you have no option but to grid. 

If it is available to read, does not mean it is your direct agenda. It just means you have the ability to consume.

## Skipping Content
There is a plethora of weird wonky content published across the web. In a learning experience, we choose to skip some, they add up.
Mostly when herd mentality takes over, favouritism. 
`If all only want to make Jarvis, Jarvis would never be made.`

Picking some of such skippable content creates backups (safety net of sorts)

## Grouping = Fun
Some things must be done alone.
Their fruit is incomplete if not complete. Sharing not possible.


But wherever possible,
* Encourage Parting
* Faster loops in a group 

## Focused on Jobs/Reputations
These Awards, Reputations, Positions - all have a very harsh diminishing returns.

They must be done in a range.

## Features
Self-explanatory "route" fields - don't need programmer.
