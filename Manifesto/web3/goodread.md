## Best Practices Advice to Aid Agency Web 3.0 Migration Efforts

Public policy entrepreneur, open government activist
and negotiation expert, David Eaves is currently
retained by several governments to advise on open
government and open data issues. He also contributed
to a book entitled Open Government: Collaboration,
Transparency, and Participation in Practice, published by
O’Reilly Media, January 2010.
Eaves offered his advice on key ways government
organizations can move toward greater collaboration and
information-sharing via public web sites. To learn more

Information is more than a byproduct of a government
organization’s mission goals, it’s at the core of any successful
organization. Government organizations still need to learn
how they can leverage information so it can be distilled, analyzed,
utilized to help agency managers make better decisions.
Data is both a strategic and public asset that is vital to
all government operations. It’s important for government
organizations to incorporate the following three guiding
principles, which have become widely accepted as a basis
for open government (namely “how to find, play with and
share data.”)
The Three Laws of Open Government Data are:
1) If it can’t be ‘spidered’ or indexed, it doesn’t exist;
2) If it isn’t available in open and machine readable
format, it can’t engage;
3) If a legal framework doesn’t allow it to be repurposed,
it doesn’t empower.
Barriers must remain low. To adhere to the Laws of
Open Government Data, government organizations shouldn’t
require users to register to access data.
Know thyself. It will be impossible to overcome cultural
barriers and achieve the interaction/collaboration and
information sharing public sector organizations claim to
want without clearly understanding what the organization
all about, and what it should strive to become.
The cultural change needed to achieve collaboration
goals takes leadership. A visionary kind of leadership is
fundamental to achieving all-important collaboration goals.
Migrating a government organization from the current status
quo to one that’s fully aware of what ‘competitors’ of all
kinds are doing, and striving to match those capabilities as
closely as possible takes a true shift of mindset for most
public sector organizations.
As government organizations rush to implement open
data portals, it’s important to remember those online efforts
must be sustainable. In other words, manually updating the
data in these portals won’t work. Government organizations
must figure out how to automate data updates.
Enlist help from good librarians and designers. In
order to be navigable, open data sites must have excellent
design, requiring a breed of librarian capable of thinking in
the online space, to help create a system for locating data
sets quickly and easily. It’s important to think about how the
site will evolve to avoid problems in the categorization of
data later.
Don’t fear feedback. No data set is perfect. Once citizens
start accessing data on the site, they will find mistakes. Ask
to be notified of errors. Harnessing the eyes of the public
will enable government organizations to identify and fix
problems more quickly. 
