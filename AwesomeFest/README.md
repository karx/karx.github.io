# AwesomeFest
An Awesome Fest to celebrate, embrace and grow Awesome.
This document is to brainstorm and seed what an Awesome Fest

## What is AwesomeFest
Making list is not just about productivity, it's more, it's Awesome.

AwesomeFest aims to bring together these list-o-maniacs, with the aim to 
* Celebrate
Highlight contributors, well-maintained lists, long time supporters.

* Embrace
Showcase tools, success stories, use-cases, daily hacks on how/when we use different awesome lists.

* Grow
Planned edit-a-thons, helping first-time contributors, share contribution stories, Microblog around the event in general

## How can we make AwesomeFest happen?
We would need some tools. I wonder where can I get a comprehensive list that can help me with this.
I propose that we start with gathering in a volunteer group, those who can help make this happen, for this setup a Discord Group.
- [ ] Volunteer Discord Group

I expect and hope a month worth of calling for Volunteers should get us in a good place.
We can then split ourselves into smaller *roles* for efficiency.


Next and hardest task would be to isolate and fix the agenda. I am flowing with ideas, but I feel the specifics are for all to decide together. Some categories of session/slots we could have during the event

* Editathons
The name I think explains a lot itself. Slots with specific awesome-list or domain. 
We might even get authors/maintainers of the list to moderate (Wishful thinking)

* Round Tables 
A formal round tables targeting a specific GitHub issue. During MozFest I attended some sessions like these. It was amazing to see what a moderated call of 5-6 almost new people on a zoom call was able to spark in a discussion.

* Showcase
A small story of someone getting a job, someone hiring, finding the right tool, discovering a new hobby. ~ lightning talks from the community.

Based on the popularity and awesome community of awesome, opening up RFPs for sessions would yield to incredible proposals.

## When can we do this?
Now is as good a time as ever.
