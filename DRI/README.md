# DRI
designated response individual or designated responsible individual

## Who is a DRI
I came across this rolling devops kind of responsibility while working for the Knowledge Graph team of Bing, STCI. 
This is the person who is responsible for primarily monitoring and replying to email messages sent to a hot issues mailing list. For online services, itâ€™s the person responsible for dealing with live site issues.

## Main Responsibilities
* Monitoring and replying to new issues or mails to the project
* Deal with live site issues - informing and working with teams to get them resolved.
* Proactively monitor the builds and current pipeline
* Versioning and Release notes if needed
* Sign off to next DRI

Having a DRI cycles makes all involved to work on the project ops, which drives multi-disciplinary innovations and improvements.
