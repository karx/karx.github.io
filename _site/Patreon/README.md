## Thank you
Thank you for joining this awesome community. 

Let get this journey started right away,
these days I was wondering and exploring the ways we can visualize.
Soon realized that standards like OpenGL provides the closest way to have a visual description of mathematical manifestation of the real world.

Though interesting, and even eased by the existence of WebGL, it is an un-trivial task.
The month of March and April I will have most of my computes targeted at this.

And what we are trying to visualize is also trivial, yet extremely powerful in helping you share your visualizations, your hand gestures/movements!
We have started with tracking a mobile phone (using a web-app), then would move on to more sophisticated(but cheaper) sensors and mechanisms.

## IoT Story
We have been working in the domain of IoT for the last 2 years, which has enabled us to be fluid with the Arduino Framework.
Though, our current choice of stack is following
* Board: ESP32 or ESP8266
* Platform/Framework:  Arduino Framework mostly, but if requirements need, (very specific) ESP-IDF
* Language: C++ Lua

But this choice is different for each project based on the logic, required sensors-actuators and connectivity scenario.

Our product portfolio in this domain would include the following:
 - SmartHome Switches (For Indian markets)
 - e-bike renting and telemetry system 
 - Air Quality Pots
 - Smart Community Tools


Over the last couple of years, we have isolated a few learning that we conduct sessions/workshops on in our local developer communities on these topics. Here is for short writeup as a reference.
- https://karx.github.io/ESP/ : Session on Current choice of Arduino inspired IoT Stack - Language + Framework + boards, 
- https://karx.github.io/Esprunio/ : One of the upcoming JS frameworks for Arduino based devices

We would be delighted to help you with an ESP8266 targeted getting started Tutorial.
Looking forward to hearing from you. 

## API and Bots Story
We have been working in the domain of Web Technologies for the last 2 years, which has enabled us to be fluid with such integrations and plugins.
Though, our current choice of stack/Toolkit is following
* Online Scripting:  Node.js Lambda Functions 
* API Sharing/Testing/Storing: Postman
* Rapid prototyping: Node-red

But this choice is different for each project based on the buisness requirement and the scenario.

Our product portfolio in this domain would include the following:
 - Dialogflow integrations with chatbots
 - OAuth or SSO implementations
 - Telegrams Bots
 - Smart Community Tools
