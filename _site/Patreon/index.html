<h2 id="thank-you">Thank you</h2>
<p>Thank you for joining this awesome community.</p>

<p>Let get this journey started right away,
these days I was wondering and exploring the ways we can visualize.
Soon realized that standards like OpenGL provides the closest way to have a visual description of mathematical manifestation of the real world.</p>

<p>Though interesting, and even eased by the existence of WebGL, it is an un-trivial task.
The month of March and April I will have most of my computes targeted at this.</p>

<p>And what we are trying to visualize is also trivial, yet extremely powerful in helping you share your visualizations, your hand gestures/movements!
We have started with tracking a mobile phone (using a web-app), then would move on to more sophisticated(but cheaper) sensors and mechanisms.</p>

<p>You can get started reading about this current thread here: https://karx.github.io/kCanvas/</p>

<h2 id="iot-story">IoT Story</h2>
<p>We have been working in the domain of IoT for the last 2 years, which has enabled us to be fluid with the Arduino Framework.
Though, our current choice of stack is following</p>
<ul>
  <li>Board: ESP32 or ESP8266</li>
  <li>Platform/Framework:  Arduino Framework mostly, but if requirements need, (very specific) ESP-IDF</li>
  <li>Language: C++ Lua</li>
</ul>

<p>But this choice is different for each project based on the logic, required sensors-actuators and connectivity scenario.</p>

<p>Our product portfolio in this domain would include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SmartHome Switches (For Indian markets)</li>
  <li>e-bike renting and telemetry system</li>
  <li>Air Quality Pots</li>
  <li>Smart Community Tools</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the last couple of years, we have isolated a few learning that we conduct sessions/workshops on in our local developer communities on these topics. Here is for short writeup as a reference.</p>
<ul>
  <li>https://karx.github.io/ESP/ : Session on Current choice of Arduino inspired IoT Stack - Language + Framework + boards,</li>
  <li>https://karx.github.io/Esprunio/ : One of the upcoming JS frameworks for Arduino based devices</li>
</ul>

<p>We would be delighted to help you with an ESP8266 targeted getting started Tutorial.
Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>

<h2 id="api-and-bots-story">API and Bots Story</h2>
<p>We have been working in the domain of Web Technologies for the last 2 years, which has enabled us to be fluid with such integrations and plugins.
Though, our current choice of stack/Toolkit is following</p>
<ul>
  <li>Online Scripting:  Node.js Lambda Functions</li>
  <li>API Sharing/Testing/Storing: Postman</li>
  <li>Rapid prototyping: Node-red</li>
</ul>

<p>But this choice is different for each project based on the buisness requirement and the scenario.</p>

<p>Our product portfolio in this domain would include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dialogflow integrations with chatbots</li>
  <li>OAuth or SSO implementations</li>
  <li>Telegrams Bots</li>
  <li>Smart Community Tools</li>
</ul>
