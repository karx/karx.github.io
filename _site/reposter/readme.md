 There is an inherent culture of Content. Weâ€™re seeing the rise in the culture of content because brands are publishers, and employees are also becoming publishers. Some might shrug it off as noise instead of being a signal, but as channels, platforms, and devices become more proliferated, employees are becoming better able to be the voice of their brand. 

 Such content engineering allows real-time marketing and running contextual campains to diffrentiate your brand.
 
 Content is quickly moving past marketing and is becoming a piece of the puzzle that is the way people interact with the world around them.
