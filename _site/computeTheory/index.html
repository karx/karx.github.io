<h2 id="dump">Dump</h2>
<p>Well, we could think of computes as the most fundamental observable unit in the physical world.</p>

<p>Over the last few decades, we have come to a conclusion that our universe, as we know it is “alterations” (there is a better word) in the fundamental fields, but when we try to observe these values as particles, we have limitations.
I want to argue here that if instead of studying them as particles, a much more productive and useful endeavor would be to study them as computes.</p>

<h2 id="why-computes">Why Computes</h2>
<p>This provides us with a much practical way of understanding these physical manifestations of the real world.
So, if we think about this for a minute, what it would mean is,
There are billions and billions of computes running, and the tick rate of this is the speed at which our universe operates, and the final outcome of any event, is the cumulative of all the computes.</p>

<p>I would like to add a concept of self-referential computes here early on. These are the computes, that have the potential of affecting the outcome of their own future computes.
These evolved systems of self-referential compute are we call ‘living’</p>

<p>as compared to ‘non-living’ compute systems.</p>

<h2 id="self-referencial-compute-systems">Self-referencial Compute Systems</h2>
<p>What we call living beings. Well the ones we have acknowledged.
One repercution of thinking of living beings as Self-referencial compute systems is, the online communities that we see, are also examples of living beings, the rain we see are compute outputs of a much larger being.</p>

<h2 id="computes-that-you-like">Computes that you like</h2>
<p>This abstraction really is amazing.</p>

<h2 id="you---a-compute-system">You - a compute system.</h2>
<p>Embracing the idea, like all such ideas makes it ‘actually powerfull’.</p>

<h2 id="to-studyexperiment">To study/experiment</h2>
<p>Interactions between diffrenet types of compute systems.
Like humans and online communities</p>
