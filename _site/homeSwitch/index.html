<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This documentation is to serve as a ‘Statement of Work’ or SOW for developing and implementing a homeSwitch System for Abacus Services, to enable them goto Market Product. The advancement in the field of IoT, Networks, Computing and Data Science has made possible Integrated systems that can really help business.
Such a system would include a means to capture, catalog and analyze data, along with tools to enforce ‘business logic’.</p>

<p>Akriya Technologies will work with Abacus Services to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Designing the homeSwitch System</li>
  <li>Design and Develop a Mobile Application</li>
  <li>Desing and Develop firmware for homeSwitch devices.</li>
  <li>Documentation of homeSwitch System</li>
</ul>

<p>The Value Proposition of using Akriya Technologies for this project are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Proven engineering techniques for making Integrated systems.</li>
  <li>Leveraging our experience in working with IoT toolkit (ESP) to bootstrap your effort.</li>
  <li>Using our subject matter experts to complete the project quickly. Rapid project completion minimizes disruptions and allows organizations to realize cost saving quickly.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="delivery-scope">Delivery Scope</h2>
<p>The scope of this project is to design, implement and deliver an end-user consumable product/system for homeSwitches. This would include</p>
<ul>
  <li>A interface for the end-user: A mobile App</li>
  <li>In-wall devices: Arduino based devices</li>
  <li>Process definations for Installation, mantaince and debugging</li>
</ul>

<p>The homeSwitch system is proposed to have no dependencies to the internet, and should be a full-funtional system while offline.
The feasibility of few techniques to have such a system, would be conducted while the designing and development of the system.</p>

<h2 id="devices">Devices</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Offline - Indivisual Hotspot Devices</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    Max connected devices to App: 1
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>To connect to any device, we hop into the indivisual operating channel of the device.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ToBe Tested: We would want to have online logging mechanism if feasible</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Online - Always connected Devices</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    Max connected devices to App: All n
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>To connect to any device, we would maintain a central state, which then interfaces with the devices. There is no direct link b/w App and devices</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Logging mechanism would provide, indivisual event wise telemetry</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>homeSwitch Specs</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Sensors :   8 x 5V digital Input

Actuators:  8 x 5V digital Output

Addons:     Real-time clock system

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This hardware is supplied by Abacus Services, and we provide firmware to make it work as a homeSwitch System component</p>

<h2 id="websoftware">Web/Software</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Admin SDK / APIs for Devices
Native packages to interact with the devices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>End-user App
A user interface exposed as a mobile Application as required by Abacus Services.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Design/Requirements for this App to be agreed upon prior to any further development.</p>

<h2 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h2>
<p>To be maintained for 6 months and then rediscuss based on new requirements and learnings.</p>

<h2 id="exclusions">Exclusions</h2>
<p>The followings are excluded from the project scope</p>
<ul>
  <li>The packages used and maintained by Akriya Technologies for interfacing with IoT Devices.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
<p>The deliverables are listed below.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Device - firmwares
This would include the source codes along with a protoype device to demonstrate the working system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Software
Access top level Git repositories for the User App and Admin SDK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Documentation and graphical depictions of the new proposed homeSwitch System.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="customer-responsibilities">Customer Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The nature of this engagement dictates that Akriya Technologies receive a frequent and enthusiastic response from the appropriate personnel.</li>
  <li>A weekly review between the Akriya Technologies consultant and the Fitso project lead or his designate will ensure that the expectations of this engagement are met.</li>
  <li>Client will assign a key contact who will be responsible for providing Akriya Technologies with information, access to personnel, and facility access.</li>
  <li>Client will provide a work area space with desk, chair, Internet access for use by Akriya Technologies to conduct project business while working on-site.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="investment-and-cost">Investment and Cost</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Man-hour required: 1 months: 2 lakh INR</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Server/Web hosting charges*:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>60$ / month = 4000 INR</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>*Bill separately for travel costs will be billed at actual cost and will not exceed 10,000 INR for the entire project.</p>
