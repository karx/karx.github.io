<p>Opt1: Why is it all about Data?</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>In the last 30 years, since the advent of the mordern day “Internet”, we as humans have experieced transformation - by the hands of technology in almost all sectors.From - On demand <strong>Transport Service</strong> to <strong>Government’s pervasive “Judging” criterias</strong>. 
We see gentically enginnered crops to maximum yeild to an i-pad designed to ease.</p>

<p>how we</p>

<p>transporte - ourselves and our goods
communicate our thoughts
how do we eat/live/sleep
how we mate - find new people - connect
how we explores
how we educate</p>

<p>We change - at an accelerating rate.</p>

<p>We are the first generations of humans to see Earth as whole in a real photgraph, hell a video, pay more money and you can book a luxury hotel in Space, overlooking the Earth, and the Moon in the backyard.</p>

<p>We are the first species to “observe” evolution</p>

<p>We are the only species to have the largest distributed collective</p>

<p>We are the only consious beings to have pictured a black hole! (optimistic much?)</p>

<hr />
<p>And a theme has emerged. Data - capturing, understanding, viewing, analysing, storing!, sorting!, structuring!, sharing!, collaborating!
—</p>

<h2 id="a-special-thanks-to-devops">A special Thanks to DevOps</h2>
<p>A special thanks to what is vaguily termed in the technology Domain as “Dev Ops”
who have made such a world possible. 
As a enginner, a scientist, an enthusiast, an explorer, you only have to ask the write question. The How and the what has been solved, optimized, surfaced and shared by them!</p>

<h2 id="why-is-it-about-data">Why is it about Data?</h2>
<p>What we are really trying to answer here is what is the truest form of Data.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-does-the-data-say">So what does the data say?</h2>
<p>It depends on the eye of the Analyst. In your case - its me.</p>
