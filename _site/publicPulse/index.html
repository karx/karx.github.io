<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This documentation is to serve as a ‘Statement of Work’ or SOW for designing, upgrading and maintaining the PublicPulse initiative by IODA. The PublicPulse Survey is already online and the key responsibility would be upgrading and imporving it to drive more engagement and improve quality of data cataloged.
Networks, Computing and Data Science has made possible Integrated systems that can really help business.
Such a system would include a means to capture, catalog and analyze data, along with tools to enforce ‘business logic’.</p>

<p>Akriya Technologies will work with SmartBike to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Designing the SmartBike Data Logging Architecture</li>
  <li>Designing the SmartBike Operations Architecture</li>
  <li>Identify and integrate SmartBike infrastructure</li>
  <li>Develop and Engineer the systems</li>
  <li>Deploy said systems for SmartBike</li>
  <li>Provide documentation of the new system</li>
  <li>Knowledge Transfer/Integrate</li>
</ul>

<p>Akriya Technologies proposes to design, develop and provide installation of v1.0 of the proposed system to cater for 100-200 Bikes.
This activity will require 4-6ss weeks. The estimated cost for this activity would be 2 lakhs INR plus additional charges after deployment, valued around 3 Lakhsss</p>

<p>The Value Proposition of using Akriya Technologies for this project are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Proven engineering techniques for making Integrated systems.</li>
  <li>Leveraging our experience in working with IoT toolkit (ESP).</li>
  <li>Data Architecture and Solution experience</li>
  <li>Using our subject matter experts to complete the project quickly. Rapid project completion minimizes disruptions and allows organizations to realize cost saving quickly.</li>
