# The Simulation 
The Simulation

## Purpose
This doc is to serve as the Simulation Overall view document. This will help me categorize all the threads/work/projects/efforts into the larger scheme of things

## The stucture of the Simulatin
In order for us to categorize, we must have a abstract structure of the simulation. We shall do this iteratively, and while constructing this model, we shall in each session categorize the work.

## Current Iteration - 25th Febuary 2019
The Simulation as of now is stable.

Motivation - This is what we call driving force.
	Current society has been using Money (Fabricated Currency) because of Legacy issues. :P
	Personal motivations are way diffrenet

Social Interactions - These are the "inteactions of two compute systems.
	There are many known way to this. Talking is one of the best way to interact as the density of information flow is increblily high.
	If we also add visual data to this, the interaction becomes much richer, but sometimes makes it harder for participats to focus on everything, thus causing leakage in the flow of information.

Computing - The way the information is proccesses. The abbstraction of Computes is beyound the scope of this text.
	This is the most fundamental. The first class citizen of this simulation. 
	The archecture is to maximize the potential of these computes.

Visualizations - The way we comprehend the current state of the system, could be visually, through other reporting mechanism, anything, that divulges information about the system.

The Architecture - This is basically how these fundamental concepts sit together. 
	We could have a system with almost 0 social interactions, etc.


## Categorizations/Abstraction
The reason for this document, is to help abstract/categorize and thus help channeling the efforts(computes) to the larger picture at all times.
So for that very reason, I would try and categorize all my personal computes under this "The Simulation" banner.
The goal of "The simulation" as the name suggest, is to have a perfect replica/simulation possible.

### Simulator01 - The Karta Device
This was the first real attempt at creating an unit of this simulation.
These Karta devices are defined as any device with compute capabilities + Network capabilities.

Karta devices have indivisually a very pure purpose, event driven (also have the capability of fabricating their own computes)
The inital draft also wanted these devices to reproduce automatically, a version similar to themself, but that as you guessed was not engineered because of implementaion capabilites.

Though, for all practical purposes, this version of Simulation device is stable. A group or hive of them, does in turn create an impressive system with amazingly broad spectrum of capabilities. 
But extreamly primitive. And no way to replicate makes it useless.

## Visualizations
This mostly comprises of the idea of having a phyical/mental/visual manifestation in the 'here and now' of the system or a part of it atleast.
