<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This documentation is to serve as a ‘Statement of Work’ or SOW for prototyping of RF-card based identity tracking system in high rises and apartments - RFC system.</p>

<p>Networks, Computing and Data Science has made possible Integrated systems that can really empower business.
Such a system would include a means to capture, catalogue and analyze data, along with tools to enforce ‘business logic’.</p>

<p>Akriya Technologies will work with RFC system to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Designing the RFC system</li>
  <li>Design and Development of RFC Endpoints</li>
  <li>Desing and Development of RFC Engine</li>
  <li>Prototype Building/Manufacturing</li>
  <li>Knowledge Transfer and documentation of RFC system</li>
</ul>

<p>Akriya Technologies proposes to prototype v1.0 of the proposed system with 5-6 endpoints.</p>

<p>This activity will require (2 weeks). The estimated cost for this activity would be 50,000 INR.</p>

<p>The Value Proposition of using Akriya Technologies for this project are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Proven engineering techniques for making Integrated systems.</li>
  <li>Leveraging our experience in working with Web and Mobile Technologies.</li>
  <li>Data Architecture and Solution experience</li>
  <li>Using our subject matter experts to complete the project quickly. Rapid project completion minimizes disruptions and allows organizations to realize cost saving quickly.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-definition">Project Definition</h2>
<p>This prototyping drive can be broken down into the following modules:</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Data SDK / APIs for RFC system
The RFC system would require to expose a few endpoints for interacting with the external environment.
This would include a query endpoint for data, activity logging, events and required telemetry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On-Device Module
The Endpoints of the RFC system, who would detect, log and transmit all RF-Card interactions.
This would include connecting to the network, heartbeat mechanism, error correction and logging.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RFC system - Engine
A set of rules/functions that are required to run and maintain the RFC system.
This would include the <strong>Identity Management</strong> module of the RFC system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<ul>
  <li>RFC Endpoint
The endpoint module of the RFC system. This module would include RF-Reciever, Network capabilities and power module.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exclusions">Exclusions</h2>
<p>The followings are excluded from the project scope</p>
<ul>
  <li>The packages used and maintained by Akriya Technologies for interfacing with IoT Devices.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
<p>The deliverables are listed below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Software
Access top level Git repositories for the Dashboard (if used), on-device modules, and admin interfaces.
Ownership transfer of any 3rd party services or servers used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Documentation and graphical depictions of the new proposed RFC system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="customer-responsibilities">Customer Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The nature of this engagement dictates that Akriya Technologies receive a frequent and enthusiastic response from the appropriate personnel.</li>
  <li>A weekly review between the Akriya Technologies consultant and the RFC system project lead or his designate will ensure that the expectations of this engagement are met.</li>
  <li>Client will assign a key contact who will be responsible for providing Akriya Technologies with information, access to personnel, and facility access.</li>
  <li>Client will provide a work area space with desk, chair, Internet access for use by Akriya Technologies to conduct project business while working on-site.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="investment-and-cost">Investment and Cost</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Man-hour required: 1 week: 50,000 INR</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hardware cost (if required) to be paid by Client</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Server/Web hosting charges:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>60$ / month = 4000 INR</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>*Bill separately for travel costs will be billed at actual cost and will not exceed 10,000 INR for the entire project.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Payment Schedule</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="acceptance-criteria">Acceptance Criteria</h2>
<p>At the conclusion of this evaluation, all deliverables for this phase will be presented to RFC system for review.</p>

<p>RFC system or its representative will have five business days from the date of delivery of any document that is a deliverable to review it and request any changes.  If Akriya Technologies does not receive notification of any required changes within this period, the document will be deemed to have been accepted without modification and will be reissued as a final copy.</p>

<p>If Akriya Technologies is notified by RFC system, within the above time frame, of any changes required, Akriya Technologies will within two business days of such notification implement those changes as have been agreed between the parties.  A final copy of the document will then be submitted to RFC system.</p>
