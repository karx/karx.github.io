<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This documentation is to serve as a ‘Statement of Work’ or SOW for implementing the Digital infrastructure and products required for GymVym operations.</p>

<p>Networks, Computing and Data Science has made possible Integrated systems that can really empower business.
Such a system would include a means to capture, catalogue and analyze data, along with tools to enforce ‘business logic’.</p>

<p>Akriya Technologies will work with GymVym to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Designing the GymVym Services Architecture</li>
  <li>Design and Development of GymVym Customer Endpoints</li>
  <li>Develop and Engineer the GymVym Operational Toolkit</li>
  <li>Deployments of GymVym infrastructure</li>
  <li>Provide documentation of the new system</li>
  <li>Knowledge Transfer of GymVym</li>
</ul>

<p>Akriya Technologies proposes to design, develop and deploy v1.0 of the proposed system to cater for 1000-2000 Facilities +and 10,000+ users.
This activity will require 3 months (~12 weeks). The estimated cost for this activity would be 5 lakhs INR.</p>

<p>The Value Proposition of using Akriya Technologies for this project are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Proven engineering techniques for making Integrated systems.</li>
  <li>Leveraging our experience in working with Web and Mobile Technologies.</li>
  <li>Data Architecture and Solution experience</li>
  <li>Using our subject matter experts to complete the project quickly. Rapid project completion minimizes disruptions and allows organizations to realize cost saving quickly.</li>
</ul>
