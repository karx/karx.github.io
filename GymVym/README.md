## Executive Summary
This documentation is to serve as a 'Statement of Work' or SOW for implementing the Digital infrastucture and products required for GymVym opertaions.

Networks, Computing and Data Science has made possible Integrated systems that can really empower business.
Such a system would include a means to capture, catalog and analyze data, along with tools to enforce 'business logic'.

Akriya Technologies will work with GymVym to:

* Designing the GymVym Services Architecture
* Design and Development of GymVym Customer Endpoints
* Develop and Engineer the GymVym Operational Toolkit
* Deployments of GymVym infrstucture
* Provide documentation of the new system
* Knowledge Transfer of GymVym 

Akriya Technologies proposes to design, develop and deploy v1.0 of the proposed system to cater for 1000-2000 Facilities +and 10,000+ users.
This activity will require 3 months (~12 weeks). The estimated cost for this activity would be 6 lakhs INR.

The Value Proposition of using Akriya Technologies for this project are:
* Proven engineering techniques for making Integrated systems.
* Leveraging our experience in working with Web and Mobile Technologies.
* Data Architecture and Solution experience
* Using our subject matter experts to complete the project quickly. Rapid project completion minimizes disruptions and allows organizations to realize cost saving quickly.

## Project Defination
Based on the project overview, the project can be devided into the following modules for abstractions:

* GymVym Services Module
    This is to include the Facilites, Services, and or any Events happening at an affiliated GymVym Facility.
    - Viewing, Filtering and Exploring feature for end-users to explore available GymVym facilties
    - Event management features like - Bookings, reminders and RSVP.

* GymVym Products Module
    This would include an e-commerce like facilities to faciliate sales of GymVym branded products

* GymVym e-Trainer Module
    A bot system that helps users through out the GymVym experience. It would take care of the following responsibilites
    - Onboarding of users
    - Daily reporting
    - Live training instructions
    - FAQs
    - Feedback and Escalations

* GymVym Subcription + Identity Management
    Module responsible for managing diffrent users on our platfrom, ranging for different customer categories to operational staff.


## Software

* Data SDK / APIs for GymVym
The GymVym Engine would expose all the APIs and enpoints used for creating the GymVym System.
This would include a query endpoint, to query facilities, events and products.
Also, these APIs would make possible to have realtime bot responses.

* Dashboard - Admin
The admin dashboard would be exposed as a Web App, with identiy mangement.
Admin Interface to overlook and manage the system.
    * User View
    * Facilites Management
    * Products Management
    * Booking Management
    * Finance Management


* User App
This would be exposed as a Mobile App on both Android and iOS.
The mobile app would include the following
    * Onboarding (exposed as bot)
    * Facilites exploration with geolocation
    * Events exploration and booking
    * e-commerce experience to buy Products
    * Reporting and companion for GymVym system (exposed as bot)
    * Subscription management


## Maintenance
To be maintained for 6 months and then rediscuss based on new requirements and learnings.

## Exclusions
The followings are excluded from the project scope
* The packages used and maintained by Akriya Technologies for interfacing with IoT Devices.

## Deliverables
The deliverables are listed below.

* Software
Access top level Git repositories for the Dashboard, mobile Apps, and admin interface package.

* Documentation and graphical depictions of the new proposed GymVym system.


## Customer Responsibilities
* The nature of this engagement dictates that Akriya Technologies receive a frequent and enthusiastic response from the appropriate personnel.
* A weekly review between the Akriya Technologies consultant and the GymVym project lead or his designate will ensure that the expectations of this engagement are met.
* Client will assign a key contact who will be responsible for providing Akriya Technologies with information, access to personnel, and facility access.
* Client will provide a work area space with desk, chair, Internet access for use by Akriya Technologies to conduct project business while working on-site.

## Investment and Cost
* Man-hour required: 3 months: 6 lakh INR

* Hardware cost (if required) to be paid by GymVym
    
* Server/Web hosting charges:
    * 60$ / month = 4000 INR

*Bill separately for travel costs will be billed at actual cost and will not exceed 10,000 INR for the entire project.
