* We might switch to IRL feed for final demo

* Need to advocate the following use-case highlighted capabilities. - `Wendor Machine`, `Instagram powered Events`, `Engagement Driven Events`, `Face rekognition (AWS) based Authorization`.

* Let's plan prototype and repeat now.


### Iteration 1 plan and actions
* Gimmick story plan - Winter is here.

#### Step 1
  I shall start with a Riddle.

  The riddle leads to you posting on Instagram -> with Hastag -> #AaoKaroChul. 
  Goto the machine to collect next clue.
    
    * We give out hand written (custom) post-it notes . The idea is to create equal sized factions.
    * We give out getting started guide.

#### Step 2
All factions (teams of 3 or 4) meet and complete a group task. 
`Get AN image of - 4 people wearing slippers.`
- With a hashtag: #AaoChillKare
  

  Go to the machine to collect next clue.
  
  * We give out noseFilter + Clue (Only 2/3 sets i.e let's say 3 teams)

First 3 teams meet in the events area of 91springboard, where we have the finals.
Game options for finals (a minute to win-it game):

  * [Pick the Ice Cube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtxA3ib1XhU)


We shall register the winners as winners on face-rekognition system.


#### Step 4
Winners now approch the initial machine:
The machine in Step 1 would now give out prizes to winner if they approch the machine.
