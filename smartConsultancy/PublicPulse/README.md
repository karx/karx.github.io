# Public Pulse


## Excutive Summary
Pubic pulse would act as a data collection platform empowering users to collect data they need efficently. We would do so by providing a set of tools. These tools are engineered to perform these data collection at maximum efficency.

Along with experince for our collaboraters like m2 and IODA, Public Pulse, would have a Knowledge Transfer Pipeline setup that would help users provide nessary information needed for the platform to create a data collection schema. 
This schema is then forwarded to all the selected types of Plugins to be surfaced on different platforms. 
All these plugins log the findings to a central repository based on the defined schema. Report generated can be viewed on the dashboard for Public Pulse.
