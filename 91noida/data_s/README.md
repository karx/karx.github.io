## Data Science Workshop in 91
Presented by Susheel

## Summary
It is incredibly difficult not to get too technical and keep the content friendly for all, especially in such a diverse data Science centric topic.
Yet we saw Sushseel along with Krishna and Nitin drove the conversation from Data collections to data visualization and decision making.

There were live demos of object detection, OCR, image colourization.
