## 91Springboard | Akriya Technologies - Till now

Hi Team,

As you know, it has been over 2 years for me in this hub, I joined in November 2017, and used to visit the `Preadr` time before that.

Over the years, We have build, prototype and demoed a lot many products and concept notes in the hub. 
Some of these I get funded for, a venue, a client, and for some, we don't. 

There have been some, that were dedicatedly built for 91Springboard Sector 1 hub. These installations are not my bread earners, yet would not call them happy as there are what enables future work. Those that get traction are taken forward and others just fizzle out.

I was just compiling the list, and here is what it looks like:
* The first one being a Temperature and Humidity monitoring devices for the hub, This drove a pretty interesting Data Science meetup in the hub, where we played around with the data we collected.
* Them there was the Intercom-Notification lantern. My personal favourite.
* We recently had the Digital Icon for with hub members count up. Do you know you can even schedule custom messages and triggers for that device ;)
* And the most recent was a happy accident. Kept in the smoking zone, which for the most time had matchboxes as rewards for posing in IG with `#91life` or `#AaoChullKare` as suggested by fellow hub members.

We have in our arsenal, quite a repository of Engagement installations over the years, and would urge 91Springboard to help us build up this Arsenal even more.

### The 91Springboard Welcome Kit - The Wending Machine
There were a lot of ideas and concepts we worked out for a co-working area, for the InstaWend. I had a few conversations with hub members to try and understand a critical use-case. The best one so far is the `91Springboard Welcome Kit`
The wending machine we have can be set up to dispense a complete Welcome kit.
These welcome kits can be of a few types, example `Visitors`, `Event Attendees` and `Member Engagement`.


The refilling/stocking of the machine would be done row-wise, each row has only one type of raw material.
The machine,based on the choice on the tab, will dispense, all items required.


#### My ask
As mentioned in this thread, we are building our arsenal for these Engagement activities, and to do so we need to be an integral part of the Events-ecosystem.

Just so happens 91Springboard, is heavily invested in this ecosystem. It would be amazing if we could follow this thread and help both of us in the process.
