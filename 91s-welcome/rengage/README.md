# Re-Connect Cowork Re-Engage
In the midst of this pandemic driven remote work culture, it is almost disappointing to see how far back 91Springboard's approach has been. I cannot say this for pan India hubs, but I feel that our Noida Sec-1 is better than this.

The community we strive to thrive in the ecosystem is still live and well, however the neglect from the administrative task (understandable), has left a void which we need to address ASAP.

The following are a few quick Re-Engagement activities/hacks that can be immediately deployed.

## Re-Engagement Plan
The header addresses the why, lets deep dive into what and how can we re-engage this community have a positive impact all round.

### What would this re-engage plan entail ?
These ideologies are highly opinionated versions of what 91S Manifesto (is there a 91s Manifesto document?)

* Co-work driven Zeal to work. 🔥
There are many small teams who prefer a cowork env for their teams, as **a productive environment is contagious**.

* Keep busy, and explore. 🕶
For a few, this environment provides a way to explore and invest in new avenues after taking an early retirement 🐼.

* Offload the tedious. 📠
High productivity teams often find themselves unintentionally collaborating to mitigate/automate the mundane.

* One Stop Shop. 🍹
Work life balance is a `startup` ecosystem is hot-topic. Setting the culture, improving the culture, spreading awareness.

* Dhanda. 💰
Getting clients, sharing clients, resource pooling, hiring, leads, all the good stuff.

### How to enforce ?
This documents come from the understanding of lack/deficit of cash-flow caused by the pandemic driven shift.

The how, of we can re-ignite this flame, with a tiny spark, is a challenge. The current approach proposed here is a few systemically planned **open channels** and **events** for all. We might have to bootstrap them for the initial few, however, our community would jump onto taking charge of these initiatives.

#### Open Channels
These are a few open line of communication/feed, that we open for our community members. I will describe the following two:
* IT help

Drives: 🕶📠💰

```
Camera not working on Zoom?
What mouse/keyboard to buy?
Having internet issue at home?
```

We are Indians, let's embrace it :P (JK)   

The **Intercom** setup on cowork sub-domain is already set for 91S community, and also mapped hub wise, actuating this channel is as easy as an announcement Emailer followed by manning those stations.


* Hub Tour

Drives: 🕶🐼🍹

This is more for keeping the roots on the place and feel more in control. 3-4 camera around the hubs, for the members to see how the hub is doing. I am personally in contact with personal on ground near the hub who I request every so often to send images on WhatsApp of the places around the hub, it nice to see.

For the Sector 1 hub, I propose:

```
A camera at the hub entrance.
A camera in community area.
Camera outside Guard house
```

Setting this up requires placing a laptop at the desired location. I would suggest **streaming** this channel on open platforms like Twitch and/or YouTube. **24x7 Live Feed**.


#### Events
91S has expertise on this domain, on how `events` in this ecosystem are driven, conducted and made success. I was hoping to see more events coming from 91S side.

A carefully curated string of events goes a long way. I hoping to hear back from the concerned personal from 91S to take this forward, as I would love to augment the events for the Remote day and age.

For setting this up, requires event owners/captain which are quite abundant in the 91S team. Webinars and live events are nothing new. Streaming these live events for members, as well on public platforms would help engage our `Whats`

Proposed list of events for Noida hub:
* Empowering Remote working   
Drives: 🕶📠💰

* Improve your home working setup   
From lighting to ergonomic positioning.   
Drives: 🕶📠

* Community Unwinds   
Drives: 🐼🍹

* How to/DIY builds from community showcase   
Drives: 🕶🐼🍹💰


* Co-Pitch sessions
Drives: 🕶🐼💰



These can be arranged as indivisual webinars/sessions or a 5-6 hour live meet. Virtual meets setting would allow us to network with other members interested in these topics.

## Notes/Conclusions
Tbh, I am salty, with how things have been operating at the hub, which is no secret btw. I have been sharing concerns and trying to work **with** the 91Springboard team on many issues over the last few years, most of which have led to significant time and effort loss for me.


Almost always, it was community members who had to offline create and enforce, which worked as we were the majority presence in the hub. It was simply easier. The **Cofounder Group** is one of the best working examples of this.

However, this pandemic has caused loosened the ties maintained by physical proximity. These threads now (should) run through 91S platforms.   
I write this in blind hope, to save **my second home**, from an impending doom.
