Thank you for joining this awesome community. 

Let get this journey started right away,
these days I was wondering and exploring the ways we can visualize.
Soon realized that standards like OpenGL provides the closest way to have a visual description of mathematical manifestation of the real world.

Though interesting, and even eased by the existence of WebGL, it is an un-trivial task.
The month of March and April I will have most of my computes targeted at this.

And what we are trying to visualize is also trivial, yet extremely powerful in helping you share your visualizations, your hand gestures/movements!
We have started with tracking a mobile phone (using a web-app), then would move on to more sophisticated(but cheaper) sensors and mechanisms.
