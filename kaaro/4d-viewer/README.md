## 4D Visualizer
In the quest to be able to visualize 4D better, started building a 4D visualizer.

What better way to, right?
Got to put those WebGL skills to test also.


This entry is still unfinished and work in progress. Well like most of my other entries.

### Thoughts and Description
A few thoughts I had while working.
How 3D entities (like us humans as example) views is `2D` + `meta`


This `meta` can be defined as 
* Movement (Choice-based, like moving around to view)
* Movement (Time-based...ish*)
* Lighting (Fixed and Choice) 


This `2D`, can be described as:
- The projection of the 3D scene (inside the Viewing frustum) on the front face.
- The closest face is a Rectangle, has 4 sides, all of which act as the infinity, i.e If you try and look at it, it simply extends. 
- The projection of the 3D scene (inside the Viewing frustum) on the front face.
- The closest face is a Rectangle, has 4 sides, all of which act as the infinity, i.e If you try and look at it, it simply extends. 

I would like to describe the viewing frustum more here. 
The viewing frustum is nothing but a cube, which looks and feel elongated because of our perspective, i.e Camera position.

So for a 4D entity, it must/might be `3D` + `meta`.
This `3D` would be:
- A projection of the 4D construct  on the front Cube.
- While traversing this 4D space, we would see the 3D scene animate, elongate and get lost into infinity, not change.

The following is true when NOT working on a celestial scale or a microscopic scale,
- not change = Very far
- get lost into infinity = Very close
- Animating = comparable shape size


### Questions that popped
* Can anybody visualize a 4D that is not a regular geometric object, like an Apple.


### Unfinished Thoughts 
* Can we use sound/haptic feedback as an additional input to Player/Viewer, as this would ease up on visuals as already overstrained.
We can use sound intensity to indicate use how far he is from a marker he/she can place while plotting. Will help him/her understand it's the radial distance from the marker at all times.
