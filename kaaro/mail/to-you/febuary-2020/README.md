## February 2019 - Mail to You

Hi !
February was quite long for all of us.
The days were short, insufficient almost and the nights endless, till the sun came up to revitalize for the next.

### Overview
The general sentiment of the month was - 
`merchandise`, `gaming`, `events` and `meetups`


### Top activities
