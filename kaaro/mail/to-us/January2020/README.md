2020 has begun and we have had a good entry to this calendar year
* Our bills are paid
* clients are settling
* products are shaping
* and we looking to expand 

We are yet not cash-rich & also had to pick yet another project to keep the ball rolling, namely Project AdEngine.

Our push towards [Gratification Machines (WE) ](https://we.akriya.co.in) seems to have slowed down and has me worried. I aim to at least have 1 if not more, paid installations of a Gratification Machine each month.

Our current Engagement with Abacus Services as tech providers feels quite strained as of now and requires re-evaluation. The efforts put in - to - returns is a very skewed ratio. An operational team is required for this project, without which we will be stuck in a standstill.

Other activities in Services front, we continue to maintain, develop and deploy viragram web offerings
* viragram.me
* ig.viragram.me
* vidiyo.me

The development & design of Vidiyo.me has been extremely slow and almost re-inventive at each turn, and we are to take credit for most of that. Strong measures are needed to get back on track. 'Nitinc' has been instrumental in setting us up for the last few months, I feel it is now upto us to prove our worth.

This month I also visited Banglore and Hyderabad to explore and tap into opportunities there. A few of our dormant Products/Projects like kaaroViewer seems to have caught people's attention there. Special mention for iForge3D from Hyderabad, who also run a makerspace there, are helping us out with `Lighte-hi-Lighte`.

This month,
* We have AdEngine delivery to pay for the bills.
* Two new Gratification machines deployment (as till now, unable to get a paid gig)
* FaceEvents POC with Dheeraj Sir for Hardware needs.
* started onboarding for 3 roles to be filled in March 2020

We are hiring for 3 roles: [Frontend Engieener](https://kaaro.akriya.co.in/hire/frontend/), Graphic Designer, and Product Evangelist.
Please share referrals, on successful onboarding I discussed with Nitin, we do have a few Amazon Cash vouchers that we can look into :P.

Finally,
We are technology providers, we focus on the product, we focus on the people using it. *Not on getting more to use*

We aim to enable, ease and empower connected devices experiences
