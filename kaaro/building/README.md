## The Building Game
Based on game created by SethBling in Minecraft

## Extra
Wanted to build on stream however the infra has failed me.

## Infra Talk
* Will be using firebase as the Central state machine.
* Will have a firebase admin service running maybe? To process the actions
* The FE is divided into two parts. The controller & the status dashboard.

### The controller
This is the main UI for the game. This is where all user inputs are taken.
We need a good Paint/Building mechanism for this. 

Let's explore the depths and width of OSS to find one for us.

### The status Dashboard
Will only display current status of the game, etc.
