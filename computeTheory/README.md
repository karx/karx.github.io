# Compute Theory

## Dump
Well, we could think of computes as the most fundamental observable unit in the physical world.

Over the last few decades, we have come to a conclution that our universe, as we know it are "alterations" (there is a better word) in the fundamental fields, but when we try to observe these values as particles, we have limitations.
I want to argue here that if instead of studing them as particles, a much more productive and useful endavour would be to studyh them as computes.

## Why Computes
This provides us with a much practical way of understanding these physical manifestations of the real world.
So, if we think about this for a minute, what it would mean is,
There are billions and billions of computes running, and the tick rate of this is the speed at which our universe operates, and the final outcome of any event, is the cumulative of all the computes.

I would like to add a concept of self-referencial computes here early on. These are the computes, that have the potential of affecting the outcome of their own future computes.
These evolved systems of self-referencial computes are we call 'living'

as compared to 'non-living' compute systems.
