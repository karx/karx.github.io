# Compute Theory

## Dump
Well, we could think of computes as the most fundamental observable unit in the physical world.

Over the last few decades, we have come to a conclusion that our universe, as we know it is "alterations" (there is a better word) in the fundamental fields, but when we try to observe these values as particles, we have limitations.
I want to argue here that if instead of studying them as particles, a much more productive and useful endeavor would be to study them as computes.


## Why Computes
This provides us with a much practical way of understanding these physical manifestations of the real world.
So, if we think about this for a minute, what it would mean is,
There are billions and billions of computes running, and the tick rate of this is the speed at which our universe operates, and the final outcome of any event, is the cumulative of all the computes.

I would like to add a concept of self-referential computes here early on. These are the computes, that have the potential of affecting the outcome of their own future computes.
These evolved systems of self-referential compute are we call 'living' as compared to 'non-living' compute systems.



## Self-referencial Compute Systems
What we call living beings. Well the ones we have acknowledged.
One repercution of thinking of living beings as Self-referencial compute systems is, the online communities that we see, are also examples of living beings, the rain we see are compute outputs of a much larger being.



## Computes that you like:
This abstraction of 'compute systems' really is amazing and helpful here. Helps define/identify tasks that align and help you acheive state of flow.



## You - a compute system.
Embracing the idea, like all such ideas makes it 'actually powerfull'.



## To study/experiment
Interactions between different types of compute systems.
Like humans and online communities


## Let's talk
This is mostly based on a conversation we (me + the Orator) struck during rush office time. The keyboards were clicking.

There is no direct co-relation we draw between our consciousness and the physicality we observe.
No equation that equates our degree of being conscious (awareness) and the spread of light visible to us.
We do not know if being in a state of flow (i presume higher awareness state), leads to increase in the observable size of electron, or a decrease.

There is a no direct unit of measurement of the degree, __of awareness__
Here i propose, moments per second.
ðŸŒ„ = moments/second (degree of awareness)

This unit signifies a quantitative unit that is able to give a number to the degree of awareness. A person said to be in higher state of awareness when very emotional (both +ve or -ve).
People who work in challenging and interesting areas are said to jump in a state of flow. These states would be quantifiable measured and thus help us in better understanding.

This is only a measure of awareness, as we understand. Consciousness is the something larger than this, let me talk a bit more to clarify this point. All things observable are part of a conscious systems. The scale/type/interactions mediums/... at which they exist happen to be very different than us. But these all, belong to a coming idea/thing/concept which is Consciousness. 
The idea of ðŸŒ„(moments/sec) might help us here as well. These _different objects_, say an rock for example has a very large or a very small ðŸŒ„ as compared to human's average ðŸŒ„.

We humans, sometimes find people with whom our ðŸŒ„ resonates frequently, or has constructive interference. And sometimes find people with whom the destructive interference is clearly observable.
We also discussed this Body Clock term, often used in Hindu scriptures, suggested to maintain, 

close to 50 or 60 in - the morning.
70 as ambient during - the day
and a 50 or so when  - you sleep.

These might be designed/isolated over the years to help us resonate/have constructive interference with _other/different objects_



```
Hindu studies have units of time that are linked to consciousness: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_units_of_time

```

During this discussion we heavily focused on coming up with an experiment/setup to calculate this number, or at least find out the factors the
at can help us do so.
A scenario run in VR, 
    - where we record basic Realtime telemetry (pupil movements, pulse etc.) to calculate Body Clock/Body Cycle Speed.
    - questionnaire/follow-up reading

The Orator emphasized on the fact that such the attendee/subject must be unaware of such a telemetry setup as that would bring bias to the reading.
