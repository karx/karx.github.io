## Executive Summary
This documentation is to serve as a 'Statement of Work' or SOW for maintaining and developing new features for homeSwitch System for Abacus Services, to enable them goto Market Product. The advancement in the field of IoT, Networks, Computing and Data Science has made possible Integrated systems that can really help business.
Such a system would include a means to capture, catalog and analyze data, along with tools to enforce 'business logic'.

Based on the learnings from V1 of homeSwitch, Akriya Technologies will work with Abacus Services for homeSwitch V2:

* Stability of current homeSwitch System
* Voice Command Unit
* SMS Control Unit
* Update the documentation of homeSwitch System


The Value Proposition of using Akriya Technologies for this project are:
* Proven engineering techniques for making Integrated systems.
* Leveraging our experience in working with IoT toolkit (ESP) to bootstrap your effort. 
* Using our subject matter experts to complete the project quickly. Rapid project completion minimizes disruptions and allows organizations to realize cost saving quickly.

## Delivery Scope
The scope of this project is to maintain and update the homeSwitch System. This would include
 - end-user application: A mobile App
 - In-wall devices Firmware: ESP32 based devices
 - Voice Control Units
 - SMS Control Units

V2 homeSwitch system will maintain to have no dependencies to the internet, and should be a full-funtional system while offline.
The feasibility of few techniques to have such a system, would be conducted while the designing and development of the system. 

### Voice Control Unit

* Built-in

> To experiment with esp32-lyratd-msc-v2-2-board

 Google Home, Alexa Skill, Home Kit*
```

## Web/Software
* Admin SDK / APIs for Devices
Native packages to interact with the devices. 

* End-user App
A user interface exposed as a mobile Application as required by Abacus Services.

Design/Requirements for this App to be agreed upon prior to any further development.

## Maintenance
To be maintained for 6 months and then rediscuss based on new requirements and learnings.

## Exclusions
The followings are excluded from the project scope
* The packages used and maintained by Akriya Technologies for interfacing with IoT Devices.

## Deliverables
The deliverables are listed below.
* Device - firmwares
This would include the source codes along with a protoype device to demonstrate the working system.

* Software
Access top level Git repositories for the User App and Admin SDK

* Documentation and graphical depictions of the new proposed homeSwitch System.


## Customer Responsibilities
* The nature of this engagement dictates that Akriya Technologies receive a frequent and enthusiastic response from the appropriate personnel.
* A weekly review between the Akriya Technologies consultant and the Fitso project lead or his designate will ensure that the expectations of this engagement are met.
* Client will assign a key contact who will be responsible for providing Akriya Technologies with information, access to personnel, and facility access.
* Client will provide a work area space with desk, chair, Internet access for use by Akriya Technologies to conduct project business while working on-site.

## Investment and Cost
* Man-hour required: 1 months: 2 lakh INR
    
* Server/Web hosting charges*:
    * 60$ / month = 4000 INR

*Bill separately for travel costs will be billed at actual cost and will not exceed 10,000 INR for the entire project.

 * Payment Schedule

| Milestone                                 | Percentage    | Amount    |
| -------------                             |:-------------:| -----:    |
| Requirement Finalization                  | 0%            | 50,000 INR|
| First prototype testing + validation              | 33%           | 25,000 INR|
| App and System-wide testing + validation            | 66%           | 25,000 INR|
| Final Delivery                            | 100%          | 100,000 INR|

Devices cost to be paid on the day of installation.
Server cost to be paid directly or at the start of each month.
Travel reimbursements as and when declared.

## Acceptance Criteria
At the conclusion of this evaluation, all deliverables for this phase will be presented to Abacus Services for review.

Abacus Services or its representative will have five business days from the date of delivery of any document that is a deliverable to review it and request any changes.  If Akriya Technologies does not receive notification of any required changes within this period, the document will be deemed to have been accepted without modification and will be reissued as a final copy.

If Akriya Technologies is notified by Abacus Services, within the above time frame, of any changes required, Akriya Technologies will within two business days of such notification implement those changes as have been agreed between the parties.  A final copy of the document will then be submitted to Abacus Services.

## Assumptions
