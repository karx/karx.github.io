## What am I doing Now?
This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [Now page](https://sivers.org/nowff).   
The focus of the page is to indicate my current focus.

## Currently building
* [Thought Jumper](akriya.co.in/labs/thoughtjumper), a realtime tool to increase cognitive abilities.
* A sci-fi story board, the [844k Saga](/844k/). 
* [Ethopedia](https://ethopedia.akriya.co.in/), I am a fan.
* Streaming Toolkit: [kaaroScoreboard](https://kaaroscoreboard.akriya.co.in/), mostly overlay widgets.

## Currently playing
* Minecraft Survival: New world created on 4th April 2020, can track the worldmap here: [Current World - map](https://kaaro.gitlab.io/minecraft-worlds/current-world/). Tried updating, file got too huge.
* AoE II: Current RM 1v1 ELO: ~1350
