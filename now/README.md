## What am I doing Now?
This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [Now page](https://sivers.org/nowff).   
The focus of the page is to indicate my current focus.

## Currently building
* Minecraft [Datapacks and resource packs](/minecraft/datapack/). Mostly a [Realtime Skin viewer](/minecraft/skinviewer).
* Attempting to port the [Minecraft Building game to vanilla JS](/kaaro/building/), along side a few more multi nodes games. 
* A sci-fi story board, the [844k Saga](/844k/). 
* Project wise documentation all Projects attempted or undertaken @ [Akriya Technologies](https://akriya.co.in).
* [Ethopedia](https://ethopedia.akriya.co.in/), I am a fan.
* Live streaming tools and things. [Notes bin](/streaming/).

## Currently playing
* Minecraft Survival: New world created on 4th April, can track the worldmap here: [Current World - map](https://kaaro.gitlab.io/minecraft-worlds/current-world/). Tried updating, file got too huge.
