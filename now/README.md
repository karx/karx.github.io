## What am I doing Now?
This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [Now page](https://sivers.org/nowff).   
The focus of the page is to indicate my current focus.

## Currently building
* Minecraft [Datapacks and resource packs](/minecraft/datapack/). Also somekind of [Realtime Skin viewer](/minecraft/skinviewer).
* Working on making some [Twitch Tools](/twitch/tools). More design and definations requrired.
* Attempting to port the [Minecraft Building game to vanilla JS](/kaaro/building/). 
* A sci-fi story board, the [844k Saga](/844k/). 

## Currently playing
* Minecraft Survival: New world created on 4th April, can track the worldmap here: [Current World - map](https://kaaro.gitlab.io/minecraft-worlds/current-world/). I will try and add more markers and labels.
