## Requirement Doc for AdEngine
Document created to list and ellaborate requirements of the AdEngine POC

### Stream Simulator
This would be a DTH box simulator with HDMI out used for demo.
We will have ~20 min worth of content streaming with a fixed timetable.

### Ads
We will have a set of 5x2 Ads, i.e 2 unique ads for 5 distinct personas.
The personas can be added/edited as tags for an Ad as well as for a `on-premise` device.

### RTS Device
This `on-premise` device, with HDMI-in from DTH and HDMI-out for TV, will overlay ads based on persona.
We would provide a remote way to update current persona attached to a device.
