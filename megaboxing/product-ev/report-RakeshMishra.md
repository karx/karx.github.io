Working with Akriya Technologies was an enriching experience which too in collaboration with Dlf mall of India, a place where every Marketing student aspires to work.
My learning from this live project was super cool from asking the customer to upload pics of any of the Mannequins to their Instagram handle and to convince them to play the game of fortune was a different experience from what I have learnt till now in my PGDM programme.

It was a great experience where I get to know more about the customer insights, how it is difficult to convince an unknown people and try to make them your potential customer.
And how can I forgot those super cool outfits from different brands which too was in collaboration with ELLE Fashion magazine, a magazine with a great brand image.
The best thing what I learned from this live project was how to do a one to one contact with your potential customer, how to convince them and makes them feel that this place is for you only.

I still remember those pretty smiles on my customer's faces when they get goodies to form super cool vending machine.
What I learned was different from what I have studied till now, both of them are different it is hard to convince the customer and to make them your potential customer. But with the help of Kartik sir, I was able to do so for which I am thankful to him.


Working with Akriya Technologies was a different experience.
I would love to be a part of Akriya Technologies in future also.
Thank you so much for this live project.
