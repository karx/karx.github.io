## Thoughticon
A mental post-it/Pin/Anchor marker used to capture/label a thought along with the context it being talked about. It's a mental tool to help navigate, store, refer to discussions/conclusions/moment of clarities....

Often used to label something happening at the present moment to help reach/jump the same thought-flow in the future. It is recommended to associate additional properties/identity to a thoughticon when captured to refer to it in future.
