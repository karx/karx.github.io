## Executive Summary
This documentation is to serve as a 'Statement of Work' or SOW for the design and development efforts for the GoFetchIt __landing page__.

In the last decade we have seen immense improvements in developer ecosystems, tooling and support. This has enabled a era of collaborative building of what can be described as software-as-service era.

Such services or apps need to have:
* suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms
* continuous deployment for maximum agility
* scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices

Akriya Technologies will work with GoFetchIt to:

* Design and develop frontpage for GotFetchIt
* Enable "Request a Quote" feature
* Enable manual invoicing to the service 

Akriya Technologies proposes to design, develop and deploy v1.0 of the proposed system to cater for upto 1M users.
This activity will require 40 hours (~1 week). The estimated cost for this activity would be 60 thousand INR.

The Value Proposition of using Akriya Technologies for this project are:
* Proven engineering techniques for making Integrated systems.
* Leveraging our experience in working with Web and Mobile Technologies.
* Data Architecture and Solution experience
* Using our subject matter experts to complete the project quickly. Rapid project completion minimizes disruptions and allows organizations to realize cost saving quickly.

## Project Definition
Based on the project overview, the project can be divided into the following modules for abstractions:

* GoFetchIt Wordpress design
    This is to include the creating frontend as per requirement document.
    - Landing pages for - Who we are, How it works, Clients, Reviews and Contact us
