## TBD Topic
Opt1: Why is it all about Data?

## Abstract
In the last 30 years, since the advent of the mordern day "Internet", we as humans have experieced transformation - by the hands of technology in almost all sectors.From - On demand __Transport Service__ to __Government's pervasive "Judging" criterias__. 
We see gentically enginnered crops to maximum yeild to an i-pad designed to ease.

how we

transporte - ourselves and our goods
communicate our thoughts
how do we eat/live/sleep
how we mate - find new people - connect
how we explores
how we educate

We change - at an accelerating rate.

And a theme has emerged. Data - capturing, understanding, viewing, analysing, storing!, sorting!, structuring!, sharing!, collaborating!

We are the first generations of humans to see Earth as whole in a real photgraph, hell a video, pay more money and you can book a luxury hotel in Space, overlooking the Earth, and the Moon in the backyard.

We are the first species to "observe" evolution

We are the only species to have the largest distributed collective

We are the only consious beings to have pictured a black hole! (optimistic much?)

## A special Thanks to DevOps
A special thanks to what is vaguily termed in the technology Domain as "Dev Ops"
who have made such a world possible. 
As a enginner, a scientist, an enthusiast, an explorer, you only have to ask the write question. The How and the what has been solved, optimized, surfaced and shared by them!
