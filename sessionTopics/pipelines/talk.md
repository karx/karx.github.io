## TBD Topic
Opt1: Why is it all about Data?

## Abstract
In the last 30 years, since the advent of the modern day "Internet", we as humans have experienced transformation - by the hands of technology in almost all sectors. From - __On demand Transport Service__ to __Government's pervasive "Judging" criterias__. 

We see genetically engineered crops to maximum yield to an i-pad designed to ease.

how we:
* transport - ourselves and our goods
* communicate our thoughts
* how do we eat/live/sleep
* how we mate - find new people - connect
* how we explore
* how we educate

We change - at an accelerating rate.

And a theme has emerged. Data - capturing, understanding, viewing, analysing, storing! sorting! structuring! sharing! collaborating!
* We are the first generations of humans to see Earth as a whole in a real photograph, hell a video, pay more money and you can book a luxury hotel in Space, overlooking the Earth, and the Moon in the backyard.

* We are the first species to "observe observe" evolution

* We are the only species to have the largest distributed collective!

* We are the only conscious beings to have pictured a black hole! (optimistic much?)

## A special Thanks to DevOps
A special thanks to what is vaguely termed in the technology Domain as "Dev Ops"
who have made such a world possible. 
As an engineer, a scientist, an enthusiast, an explorer, you only have to ask the right question. The How and the what has been solved, optimized, surfaced and shared by them!
