## Executive Summary
This documentation is to serve as a 'Statement of Work' or SOW for the FaceEvents concept to enable innovation in Events Industry. The advancement in the field of IoT, Networks, Computing and Data Science has made possible Integrated systems that can really help business.
Such a system would include a means to capture, catalog and analyze data, along with tools to enforce 'business logic'.

Akriya Technologies will work on FaceEvents to:

* Designing the FaceEvents Architecture
* Designing the FaceEvents Operations Architecture
* Identify and integrate FaceEvents modules
* Develop and Engineer FaceEvents modules
* Deploy said systems for FaceEvents
* Provide documentation of the new system
* Knowledge Transfer/Integrate 

Akriya Technologies proposes to design, develop and provide installation of v1.0 of the proposed system to cater for upto 1000 Distinct Users with upto 1000 distinct buisness entities.
This activity will require x weeks. The estimated cost for this activity would be x (specs x).

The Value Proposition of using Akriya Technologies for this project are:
* Proven engineering techniques for making Integrated systems.
* Leveraging our experience in working with IoT toolkit (ESP).
* Data Architecture and Solution experience
* Using our subject matter experts to complete the project quickly. Rapid project completion minimizes disruptions and allows organizations to realize cost saving quickly.

## Project Definition
FaceEvents aims to build/design develop
```
enter Summary based on recording from Dheeraj and Anup
```
The proposed system would have the following modules:
### The Frontpage: 
This web presence, SEO friendly to tell people about FaceEvents

### User Onboarding Modules
These are set of services created for user onboarding from various platforms. These aim to collect the following data, 
User Phone number     | (Primary)
User Name/Alias       | (Stage 1)
User email-address    | (Stage 0)
User face-id          | (Stage 2)
User address          | (Stage 3)
mobile number Verify  | (Stage 3)
email address Verify  | (Stage 3)
His profile (*)       | (Stage 4)

```
Stage 0 : first interaction with the User
Stage 1 : User visits one of our site/modules
Stage 2 : User visits one of our onboarding modules
Stage 3 : User visits to verify himself
Stage 4 : User visits to build identity (Optional)
```

The following are the Onboarding services categories by Stage:

* Emailers (Stage 0)
* Flyers (Stage 0)
* List from Events Industry (Stage 0)
* WhatsApp (Stage 1)
* QRCode (Stage 1) 
* Web app (Stage 1)
* Android App (Stage 1)
* iOS App (Stage 1)
* Google Actions (Stage 1)
* Amazon Alexa Skill (Stage 1)
* Robot/On-point Voice bots (Stage 1)
* Robot/On-point Camera bots (Stage 2)
    

### On-ground Modules
These are hardware installations/plugins that enforce the FaceEvent flow.
*   Base Lock/Unlock module or __Verification Module__

This would be the base module, with camera and a compute stick with network capabilites. 

* __Identification Module__ 

These are modules linked for capturing usage statistics from the camera for different location, linked to a buisness identity
They would interact directly with the FaceEvent services.

* __Feedback Modules__

These are screens and visual displays linked to an expensive SOC to help enforce, facilitate and ease the FaceEvents flow.

### On-cloud Services
These are set of services deployed as a backend for the Onboarding and Ongound modules.
* Authentication
* User data management
* Data storage (face-images, assets, etc) 
* Common Onboarding APIs - (new, update, delete, blacklist) 
* Common FaceEvents APIs - (detect, fetch)


### Admin-dashboard
To be consumed by superusers. Help create reports, logs, etc.


## Devices/HW

* Robot/On-point Voice bot

```
Data to Capture:    Name
                    Mobile number 

To link:    FaceEvents web link
            FaceEvents mobile app     
```



## Web/Software
* Whatsapp bot

```
Data to Capture:    Name
                    email-address
                    image (to-be-tested)*

To link:    FaceEvents web link
            FaceEvents mobile app
            
```

## Maintenance
