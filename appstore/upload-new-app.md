## ChangeLog Weekly Video - Episode 1

<Intro>




## Uploading an APK
* Universal APK x64 bit. 
(support going to be removed for only 32x)

* APK size
80 MB - It's larger unoptimized for serving


## AAB file formats
Defination - 

Keystore file - signature

* X% of our user are uploading with wrong keystore password

* Signing methods - Alternate store and Indus Appstore
    * Mainting your single keystore for all distribution tracks:  
        * how to doc link
    * Maintining seperate keystore for all distribution tracks


> if you use Google Play Signing, AAB file format with single distribution track not an option . Universal APK export from Google play would be required.

We are working (solutioning) a mechanism to enable optimized serving file formats - and also maintain signature track - for Google Play Signing developers. 

### APK(s)
Keystores are personal. APKS is simply put - bundle yourself after creating AAB - sign it - and we help distribute these bundles.


### Other Notes
* Version Bump when you push update
* There is no revert for Android App Release - You can hault distribution of a version - but what is downloaded on user's mobile - might get installed if new update doesn't reach.
Higher version update
* Can we do Release management
*Not open to public till - (x) M user devices onboarded*
We want to do it right. We have OEM, Device level control, coupled with some powerful engine called TStore where profile table is store to build this. 
Internal products/and beta testing developers have access. 

Current functionality has the following shape/form
* DevTools API for triggering an Update (This would do a default rollout of 1%)
* Internal Portal to view Verion Releases - And control knob (percentage/OEM/Model)

* How do I get my keystore file if I use Play Signning 
Can't get keystore or signing key. Please export the universal APK from Play Store and upload as an APK. 

Or run seperate distribution track.
* Upload failed.
Error message like - "Could not upload"/"Something went wrong". please reach out to support@indusappstore.com or via chatbot.
FAQs.

* Account Verificaton Required.
We do KYC of developer accounts. It's handy to have - JK. We need to protect our user base, we need maintain the santity of the platform. Else - there is always charging people to make sure they are serious.

* Chatbot not visible
We hear your views / feedback / issues via our CX workflows. I always fear that the gateway might not be visible to some of you when you most need it. Please refresh - we won't log you out.
Registration Page often has known issues loading a chatbot in the UI.
