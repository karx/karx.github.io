## CokeCola Voting Maching 
All hail the ESP32

## Breif
Polls are great examples of leveraging the power of collective contribution.

Such was the case a week back, when we saw a couple of polls in our cowork's Telegram group. The questions were quite frankly - ODD, and the options as well - ODD

But none-the-less the poll, gathered a few responses, and also strike a few convesations in the hub!
Wanting to add-on to this party, we decided to add our own Data-Collection Device!    
And thus - The CokeCola Voting Machine.

Using the onboard-touch pins of the **ESP32**, free hosting of **github pages**, and a few cloud functions on our beloved **firebase**, and a bunch of Coke (5 cans to be precise).
We had our CokeCola Voting Machine

You want to set your own Voting station up? 
In the next 4-5 mins I would have told you how to do so. Technical or not, I'm gonna go technical - the base, because what else is needed ;).

## Setting Up
* 3 empty Cans of CokaCola - (any conductive material here would do. More details Here)
* an ESP32
* USB-wire to program
* 3 Jumper wires to connect
* USB charger
* VSC with Platform.ios
* Source Code with Logic

## Time to get Building
1. Software-ish
    Setup platformIO and Visual Studio Code on your system.
    Visual Studio Code is an amazing Code Editor.
    PlatformIO makes it so easy to work with such devices, their frameworks, toolkits, and debugging!

    * SSID and password - WIFI
    * Edit the endpoint and the questionID in the code.
    * You can setup your own endpoint for storing these interaction, or use this open hosted service. Just mention the question, the options - It will also generate required material.
