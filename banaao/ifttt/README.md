## Executive Summary
This documentation is to serve as a 'Statement of Work' or SOW for the design and development of banaao-IFTTT POC to enable IFTTT integration to existing banaao-boards and app. 

The advancement in the field of IoT Networks, Computing and Data Science has made possible Integrated systems which enable new experiences and solutions possible in the Digital Media space.
Such a system would include a means to capture, catalogue and analyze data, along with tools to enforce 'business logic'.

This SOW summarizes a banaao-IFTTT system, with the banaao-board Hardware devices

Akriya Technologies will work with banaao-IFTTT to:

* Designing the banaao-IFTTT Infrastructure
* Designing and Development the banaao-IFTTT Services
* OAuth the banaao-IFTTT Services
* Deploy said systems for banaao-IFTTT
* Provide documentation of the new system
* Submit Service for review

Akriya Technologies proposes to design, develop and provide installation of v1.0 of the proposed system to cater for 3 use-cases.
This activity will require 2 weeks. The estimated cost for this activity would be 50 thousand INR plus additional charges including travel, server rental and hardware costs.


The Value Proposition of using Akriya Technologies for this project are:
* Proven engineering techniques for making Integrated systems.
* Leveraging our experience in working with IoT toolkit (ESP).
* Data Architecture and Solution experience
* Using our subject matter experts to complete the project quickly. Rapid project completion minimizes disruptions and allows organizations to realize cost-saving quickly.

## Project Definition
IFTTT defines a clear and concise protocol which your serviceâ€™s API will implement. Each trigger and action for your service will map 1-to-1 to an API endpoint on your service built specifically for IFTTT. Trigger endpoints will be event streams that IFTTT will poll for new data. Conversely, action endpoints will be writable endpoints that IFTTT will send data to. For services that use OAuth, IFTTT is fully compatible with a couple of the common flavours of OAuth 2.0.

```

The most important part of this exercise is the description of queries, triggers, and actions in IFTTT.


### 1.1 IFTTT Service Development

### 1.2 IFTTT OAuth Setup

### 1.3 Testing

### 1.4 Submit for review

```
We would only be able to do alpha testing. Comprehensive testing out of scope
```


## Maintenance
To be maintained for 2 months and then rediscuss based on new requirements and learnings.

## Exclusions
The followings are excluded from the project scope
* The packages used and maintained by Akriya Technologies for interfacing with IoT Devices.
* Open Source Software means publicly available software that may be utilized pursuant and subject to the terms of an "open source" or similar license, including without limitation the "Ruby License," the "MIT License," the "Apache License" and the "GNU General Public License." Company understands and agrees that Consultant may, at Consultant's discretion, make use of libraries from various Open Source Software products during the course of work. We may submit back to such libraries any improvements ("patches") made to the Open Source Software during the course of work, as long as the submission of such patches violates neither the conditions in this Section nor the Confidentiality provisions.

## Deliverables
The deliverables are listed below.

* Software
Access top-level Git repositories for the SDK, on-premise firmware, and admin interface package.

* Documentation and graphical depictions of the new proposed banaao-IFTTT system.


## Customer Responsibilities
* The nature of this engagement dictates that Akriya Technologies receive a frequent and enthusiastic response from the appropriate personnel.
* A weekly review between the Akriya Technologies consultant and the banaao-IFTTT project lead or his designate will ensure that the expectations of this engagement are met.
* Client will assign a key contact who will be responsible for providing Akriya Technologies with information, access to personnel, and facility access.
* Client will provide a work area space with desk, chair, Internet access for use by Akriya Technologies to conduct project business while working on-site.

## Investment and Cost (revised)
* Time required: 2 months: 2 lakh INR (estimated 140 man-hours)

* Hardware cost (if required) to be paid by banaao-IFTTT
 
* Server/Web hosting charges:
 * 60$ / month = 4000 INR

* Bill separately for travel costs will be billed at actual cost and will not exceed 10,000 INR for the entire project for movement within NCR. (up to 10 meetings)

 * Payment Schedule

| Milestone | Percentage | Amount | Time period from Start
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----: | ----- | 
| Requirement Finalization | 40% | 20,000 INR| 0 day | 
| Module 1.1 to 1.4 | 60% | 30,000 INR| 15 days | 



Devices cost to be paid on the day of installation.
Server cost to be paid directly or at the start of each month.
Travel reimbursements as and when declared.

## Acceptance Criteria
At the conclusion of this evaluation, all deliverables for this phase will be presented to banaao-IFTTT for review.

banaao-IFTTT or its representative will have five business days from the date of delivery of any document that is a deliverable to review it and request any changes. If Akriya Technologies does not receive notification of any required changes within this period, the document will be deemed to have been accepted without modification and will be reissued as a final copy.

If Akriya Technologies is notified by banaao-IFTTT, within the above time frame, of any changes required, Akriya Technologies will within two business days of such notification implement those changes as have been agreed between the parties. A final copy of the document will then be submitted to banaao-IFTTT.

## Assumptions
* General
 * All documentation created for this project will be available in hard copy and electronic format.
 * Any modifications to the scope of work will be handled through a change control process and will be agreed to by both parties.

* Commercial
 * Additional costs may be incurred where any delay not under the control of Akriya Technologies that causes Akriya Technologies personnel to not fulfil their scheduled tasks.
 * An authorized delegate of banaao-IFTTT will be available at the time of completion of the build phase so that all documentation can be accepted and signed.
 * Additional costs may be incurred where any work scheduled to be undertaken by Akriya Technologies is postponed by banaao-IFTTT after 24 hours of its commencement.
 * All changes to the schedule or technical requirements must be provided to Akriya Technologies in written format. Email is included as written format. Receipt of all correspondence should be confirmed by phone wherever possible.
 * banaao-IFTTT has accepted the costs/times estimate as detailed in this document
 * banaao-IFTTT has accepted the Akriya Technologies standard terms and conditions linked.
 * Any deviation, technical or commercial, shall be mutually discussed and agreed before implementation.
