
## Models to Use:
* Pay via Instagram Post
Posting on Instagram using the specified `hastag` we provide digital points, that can be redeemed on the wending machine using the user's Instagram Handle.
This provides an instant gratification to the users for posting at the venue.

Every post = 1 point
So, if user does `n` posts, he is eligible to wend `n` points worth of items.
We recommend using 1 point per wend to keep the expirence simple.

* Instagram Raffle
Who does not like good raffle.
Instagram Raffle provides a unique way to drive engagement of an event or a location.

Using the pool of posts for on a specific `hastag` or `mentions`, we can provide the following:
 - Luck winner (every hour)
 - Mega winner (every day)
 - All time winner (overall event)

The Lucky winners would be announced on the Wending Maching UI, as well as DMs to the Announcers/Operation Staff.

* Wending Wheel of Fortune
Try your luck on Wending Machine.

Very similar to `Pay via Instagram`, instead every post gives you a chance to run at the wheel of fortune.
We have 5 trays of options, along `1 free token`, `a follow back on instagram` and `No win`.
