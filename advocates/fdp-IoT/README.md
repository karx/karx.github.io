# FDP - IoT for Emerging Technical Applications

## Introduction
This document is to serve as a proposition and brief for conducting a two weeks FDP on IoT for Emerging Techincal Applications in Smart City. Our current and past experience on-ground implementing and developing IoT based solutions has brought us with some learnings.
These learnings spread across the domain of Web Development, SOC devices and networking.

Current deployment of IoT based systems are mostly web centric with a central clould based "manager".
We would like to divide the learning into the following categories:
* Device Managment and Communications
* Edge Devices and On-ground infrastucture
* Web Ecosystem

## FDP 2 weeks Proposition
This propositions contains the topic we concider as our "strengths" and are not a complete or comprehensive set to learn IoT.
The do however provide a good in-depth knowledge and awarness about the current implementations in the Industry.

#### Device Management and Communications 
`Week 1 (20 hours)`
We shall discuss the need, followed by few examples of IoT platforms for Device Mangement and Communications. The following technoloiges/tools would be discussed.
* MQTT
* AWS IoT Core
* PlatformIO
* LORA
* Bluetooth
* BLE
* WiFi

#### Edge Devices and On-ground infrastucture
`Week 1-2 (10 hours)`
* Arduino - the Beginner Kit
* ESP8266 and ESP32 - Developer friendly Kits
* Raspberry Pi and other Mini-computers.

#### Web Ecosystems
`Week 2 (20 hours)`
We shall deep dive into technologies and tools earlier discuessed, their integrations and more examples/demos.

* IFTTT 
* Interest Groups (Developer Communities)
* Mozilla WebThings
