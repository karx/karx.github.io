#### Why are you qualified to be a Mozilla Tech Speaker? *
List of my current activities as speaker were listed in http://kaaro.akriya.co.in/advocacy/kaaro (linked in prev answer as well).

In the last 3 years since I was first introduced, I have been attending and contributing regularly to a few communities that I felt home in, which include 
PyData, PyDelhi, Mozilla Punjab, Mozilla India and IoT-NCR.

I choose to build my material around the following topics as on date:
1. WebComponents - as the most Re-usable and compose-able units of UI.
2. Wikidata - the largest Open Crowdsourced Maintained Open Knowledge Graph
3. ESP32 - My choice of open hardware for edge-devices for IoT applications.
