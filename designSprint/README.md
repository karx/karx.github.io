
## Design Sprint
A Design Sprint, is a 5-day process used to answer critical business questions through design, prototyping and testing ideas with customers. This method allows us to reduce cycle time when coming up with a solution. In each of the five days, you are expected to accomplish several items:

    Day 0: preparatory exercises
    Day 1: map out the customer problems and decide core JTBD or Focus
    Day 2: diverge with ideas and list competing solutions
    Day 3: converge on decisions and establish a testable hypothesis
    Day 4: craft prototype
    Day 5: reveal the prototype to users
